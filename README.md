### Description
In this lab you will create a simple webapp with two routes. One route will have a basic result and the other will use dynamic query.

Open Theme. You can write about whatever you want(video games, shows, movies, etc.) as long as it has the required elements.

### Steps
1. In src -> main -> java -> Main.java create a route that displays a simple string.
2. Create another route that uses dynamic query to take in a value from the path and then displays it.
